The necessary SDK file and Myo Connect (the software that handles connections between the Myo Band and Bluetooth) are too large to be uploaded directly to GitHub at this time.

To locate these files, I have attached a link to the original GitHub repository from which I downloaded them.

Link to package source: https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/myo-python/releases/tag/v1.0.4

One-Click link to download Myo Connect: https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/myo-python/releases/download/v1.0.4/Myo+Connect+Installer.exe

One-Click link to download the necessary SDK file: https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/myo-python/releases/download/v1.0.4/myo-sdk-win-0.9.0.zip

Once downloaded, Myo Connect should run the program correctly. Please be sure to note the file path of your SDK file, as it will be important later.

Downloading Python 3.8 is also essential. ENSURE YOU DOWNLOAD THE 32-BIT VERSION!!!
